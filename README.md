# DEVISE

>  In this project, I went through the devise action we can take. I didn't know it was powerful. I created the login method add google omniauth and github. I created the tracktable and confirmable action. so we can have your history of when you logged in and how many per day including your IP address and occasion as well. If you try to log in 3 times with a wrong password, your account will be blocked and a token will be sent to you by email so you can unlock your account. Finally, I checked the login time setting after 30 minutes, you will be logged out because your session will have expired. This action is very useful, I think, for Upwork, because every day you have to log in again.This API is made these models:
